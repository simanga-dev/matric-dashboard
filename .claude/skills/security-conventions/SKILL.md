# Security Conventions

## Architecture Context

- JWT access tokens in HttpOnly cookies, refresh token rotation
- Permission-based authorization via `[RequirePermission]` attributes
- Role hierarchy: Superuser > Admin > User > Custom
- PII masking server-side via `PiiMasker` / `WithMaskedPii` - requires `users.view_pii` permission
- CSRF protection via Origin header validation on mutations
- CSP with nonce-based script-src

## Security Checklist

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Auth middleware cannot be bypassed (no unprotected routes that should be protected)
- [ ] `[RequirePermission]` on every action that needs it - not just `[Authorize]`
- [ ] Role hierarchy enforced - cannot manage users at/above your rank
- [ ] Cannot modify your own roles, lock yourself, or delete yourself
- [ ] Refresh token rotation works correctly - old tokens invalidated
- [ ] Permission changes invalidate affected users' tokens and cache

### Input Validation
- [ ] All input validated on backend (FluentValidation) - frontend validation is UX only
- [ ] File uploads: size limits, MIME type validation, no path traversal
- [ ] URL fields: restrict to http/https schemes via `Uri.TryCreate`
- [ ] SQL injection: parameterized queries only (EF Core handles this, but check raw SQL)
- [ ] No string interpolation in LINQ/SQL queries
- [ ] Rate limiting on auth endpoints and mutations

### PII Compliance
- [ ] Emails, phone numbers, usernames never exposed without `users.view_pii` permission
- [ ] PII masking happens server-side - never rely on frontend
- [ ] No PII in logs (structured logging with masking)
- [ ] No PII in URLs, tokens, or error messages
- [ ] Self-view exemption: users see their own unmasked data
- [ ] Audit trail for PII access

### Information Leakage
- [ ] Error messages use `ErrorMessages.*` constants - no stack traces, no internal details
- [ ] `ProblemDetails` for all error responses - no anonymous objects
- [ ] Identity errors: log `.Description` server-side, return static message to client
- [ ] No sensitive data in JWT claims beyond what's needed
- [ ] `SetDbStatementForText` never set to `true` in OTEL (captures SQL with PII)
- [ ] `appsettings.Development.json` and `appsettings.Testing.json` excluded from publish

### Cookie & Token Security
- [ ] HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict on auth cookies
- [ ] JWT secret is strong (64+ chars for HMAC SHA-256)
- [ ] Token lifetimes appropriate (short access, longer refresh)
- [ ] Refresh tokens are one-time-use with rotation

### CSRF & CORS
- [ ] Origin header validated on all mutations via API proxy
- [ ] CORS restrictive by default - only `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
- [ ] No `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` in production

### Response Headers
- [ ] `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- [ ] `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- [ ] `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- [ ] HSTS in production
- [ ] CSP nonce-based script-src

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Secrets in env vars or `.env` - never in code or config committed to git
- [ ] Docker containers hardened (read-only root, no-new-privileges, caps dropped)
- [ ] Database credentials not exposed in connection strings in logs
- [ ] Health check endpoints don't leak sensitive info

### Audit
- [ ] Security-significant actions audited via `IAuditService.LogAsync`
- [ ] Audit metadata serialized with `JsonSerializer.Serialize` (not string interpolation)
- [ ] Login, logout, password change, role change, permission change all audited
